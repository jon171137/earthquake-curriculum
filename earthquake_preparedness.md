# Earthquake Preparedness

## Overview
Earthquake preparedness involves advance planning and practice to protect yourself, your family, and your community when an earthquake strikes. Most earthquake injuries and deaths result from falling objects, structural damage, and panicâ€”hazards that can be significantly mitigated through proper preparation, training, and rapid response. Preparedness is not about preventing earthquakes, but about minimizing harm when they occur.

### Personal Safety During Earthquakes: Drop, Cover, and Hold On

The most effective action during an earthquake in most situations is to **Drop, Cover, and Hold On**, recommended by rescue teams, emergency preparedness experts, and organizations like FEMA, USGS, and the American Red Cross.

#### Why Drop, Cover, and Hold On?
Research on earthquake injuries and deaths over several decades shows that the greatest danger comes from **falling or flying objects** (lamps, books, chandeliers, glass, mirrors, TVs), not from building collapse. Additionally, earthquakes can occur without warning and may be so violent that movement is difficult or impossible. Attempting to run or move to a doorway increases risk of injury.

#### The Three-Step Protocol

**STEP 1: DROP**
- Get down onto your **hands and knees immediately** where you are
- This protects you from being knocked down forcefully and allows you to stay low and crawl to shelter if nearby
- Do NOT try to move more than 5â€“7 feet before dropping; the shorter the distance, the lower injury risk

**STEP 2: COVER**
- Cover your **head and neck with one arm and hand**
- If a sturdy table, desk, or bed is nearby, crawl underneath it for additional protection from falling objects
- Position your body to protect vital organs, particularly if under a table
- If no shelter is available, crawl against an **interior wall** (away from windows, exterior walls, and tall furniture)
- Do NOT stand in a doorway; this is an outdated recommendation. The area near exterior walls where windows and architectural details can fall is the most dangerous location.

**STEP 3: HOLD ON**
- If under a table or desk, hold on to one leg with one hand and keep your head down
- If against a wall with no shelter, hold on to your head and neck with both arms and hands
- Continue holding on until the shaking **completely stops**
- Be prepared to move with your shelter if it shifts

#### Specific Situations

**Indoors (Home/Office):**
- Drop, Cover, and Hold On immediately
- Avoid exterior walls, windows, mirrors, hanging objects (chandeliers, picture frames), tall unsecured furniture (bookcases, cabinets), and large appliances
- If seated and unable to drop to the floor: bend forward, cover your head with your arms, and hold on to your neck with both hands
- If in a wheelchair: apply the brake, cover your head with your arms, and ask for assistance if needed

**In Bed:**
- Do NOT get out of bed
- Lie **face down** to protect vital organs
- Cover your head and neck with a pillow, keeping arms close to your head
- Hold on to your head and neck with both hands
- You are less likely to be injured from fallen objects by remaining in bed

**At Work:**
- Immediately drop, cover, and hold on
- Move to a pre-identified safe place (under desk, against interior wall, or designated shelter area)
- If in a high-rise building, do NOT try to exit; evacuation during strong shaking is dangerous; instead, go to your designated safe area
- If driving on a highway, slowly pull over away from overpasses and power lines, stay in your vehicle, and buckle your seatbelt

**In a Vehicle:**
- Pull over safely and slowly to the side of the road
- Avoid overpasses, power lines, and large signs
- Stay inside your vehicle with your seatbelt fastened
- Proceed cautiously once shaking has stopped, watching for damage to road surfaces, fallen objects, and downed power lines

**Outdoors:**
- Move to an **open space** if you can do so safely
- Avoid buildings, trees, electrical and overhead power lines, streetlights, and vehicles
- If forced to remain near a building, drop, cover, and hold on and watch for falling debris
- Once in an open space, drop, cover, and hold on to protect yourself from objects thrown through the air

**In Public Places (Stores, Theaters, Schools):**
- Drop, Cover, and Hold On immediately
- Seek shelter under sturdy fixtures (shopping carts, clothing racks, large multi-shelf units)
- If in a crowded place, avoid panic and move orderly to the nearest safe shelter

### Before an Earthquake: Preparedness Steps

#### Step 1: Secure Your Space
- **Anchor furniture**: Secure tall furniture (bookcases, cabinets, TVs) to wall studs to prevent tipping and falling
- **Lower breakables**: Keep breakables, heavy objects, and glass items on lower shelves
- **Secure seismic restraints**: Install latches and restraints on cabinets, shelves, and closets to prevent doors from opening
- **Secure equipment**: Anchor water heaters, HVAC units, gas cylinders, and other large equipment
- **Window safety**: Apply safety film to windows to prevent glass from shattering and scattering

#### Step 2: Know Hazards and Safe Locations
- **Identify safe places** in your home, workplace, and school: under sturdy tables, desks, against interior walls (away from windows and tall furniture)
- **Avoid unsafe locations**: exterior walls, doorways (do not use this outdated recommendation), near windows, near tall furniture and hanging objects
- **Know utility locations**: Identify where gas, water, and electrical shutoff controls are located; learn to shut them off if necessary

#### Step 3: Plan and Communicate
- **Develop a family communication plan**:
  - Create a list of emergency contacts (phone numbers, email addresses, social media accounts)
  - Establish an out-of-town contact person who family members can call to check in
  - Discuss where family members will be during the day (work, school, childcare) and how everyone will reunite
  - Designate a meeting place in your neighborhood where family can gather if home is unsafe
  - Designate a second meeting place outside your neighborhood if you cannot return home
- **Share information**: Ensure all family members have copies of the communication plan; place copies in wallets, vehicles, and accessible locations
- **Verify workplace and school plans**: Check that your workplace, school, and childcare facilities have earthquake preparedness plans and drills

#### Step 4: Practice Regularly
- **Conduct earthquake drills**: Practice "Drop, Cover, and Hold On" at least **twice per year** (e.g., in spring and fall, or on official Earthquake Preparedness Day)
- **Make it automatic**: Frequent practice makes the response automatic, ensuring people don't hesitate or panic
- **Involve everyone**: Practice with family members, coworkers, and classmates
- **Practice in different locations**: Drill at home, at work, and in cars
- **Post reminders**: Display earthquake safety posters at home and work to reinforce proper procedures

### Building Your Earthquake Emergency Kit

An emergency kit ensures you have essential supplies for at least 72 hours (three days) following an earthquake. Experts recommend keeping kits both at home and in your vehicle.

#### Essential Supplies (Three-Day Supply)

### After an Earthquake

#### Immediate Actions
- **Check for injuries**: Provide first aid if trained; call emergency services (911 in the US) for life-threatening injuries
- **Look for hazards**: Watch for downed power lines, broken glass, spilled chemicals, and structural damage
- **Listen to alerts**: Tune to local radio or emergency broadcasts for information and instructions
- **Evacuate if unsafe**: If your building is damaged or you detect gas leaks, evacuate to a safe location
- **Stay calm**: Avoid panic; move carefully and help others if possible

#### Communication
- **Contact out-of-town contact**: Call or text your designated out-of-town contact person (often easier than local calls after an earthquake) to let family know you are safe
- **Meet at designated location**: If family members are separated, gather at your pre-designated meeting place
- **Do not use the phone** for non-emergency calls; keep lines open for emergency services

#### Longer-Term Response
- **Document damage**: Take photos of property damage for insurance claims
- **Listen to authorities**: Follow instructions from emergency responders and local officials
- **Avoid damaged areas**: Do not return to damaged buildings or enter cordoned-off areas
- **Offer help**: If safe to do so, assist injured persons or your community's recovery efforts
- **Seek shelter**: If your home is unsafe, go to an emergency shelter or stay with friends/family

### Community Preparedness

- **Participate in drills**: Join national or local earthquake drills (e.g., Great ShakeOut, Earthquake Preparedness Day)
- **Get trained**: Take a first-aid course (American Red Cross, American Heart Association) and CPR training
- **Know your neighborhood**: Identify community shelters, emergency medical facilities, and safe routes in your area
- **Share knowledge**: Educate friends, family, and colleagues about earthquake safety
- **Stay informed**: Follow updates from USGS, FEMA, and your local emergency management agency
