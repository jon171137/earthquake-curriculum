# California Earthquakes

## Overview
California sits on the boundary between the Pacific and North American tectonic plates, making it one of the most seismically active regions in the world.

## Content

### Tectonic Setting
- Located along the **San Andreas Fault System**
- Pacific Plate moving northwest relative to North American Plate
- Transform plate boundary (strike-slip motion)
- Multiple fault systems throughout the state

### Major Historical Earthquakes

#### 1906 San Francisco Earthquake (M7.9)
- **Date**: April 18, 1906
- **Deaths**: ~3,000
- **Damage**: Catastrophic fires, $400M+ (1906 dollars)
- **Infrastructure**: Destroyed most of San Francisco
- **Legacy**: Led to modern seismic building codes

#### 1989 Loma Prieta Earthquake (M6.9)
- **Date**: October 17, 1989
- **Deaths**: 63
- **Damage**: $6 billion
- **Infrastructure**: Bay Bridge collapse, freeway failures
- **Impact**: During World Series game at Candlestick Park

#### 1994 Northridge Earthquake (M6.7)
- **Date**: January 17, 1994
- **Deaths**: 57
- **Damage**: $20+ billion
- **Infrastructure**: Freeway collapses, building damage
- **Legacy**: Updates to building codes and retrofit requirements

### Infrastructure Vulnerabilities
- **Bridges**: Many older bridges not designed for modern seismic standards
- **Highways**: Elevated roadways susceptible to collapse
- **Buildings**: Unreinforced masonry buildings (URMs) particularly vulnerable
- **Utilities**: Water, gas, and power lines at risk of rupture

### Seismic Risk Assessment
- **High-risk zones**: San Francisco Bay Area, Los Angeles Basin
- **Probability**: ~75% chance of M7.0+ earthquake in next 30 years
- **Economic exposure**: Trillions in property and infrastructure

### Preparedness Efforts
- Statewide earthquake early warning system (ShakeAlert)
- Mandatory seismic retrofitting programs
- Regular earthquake drills (ShakeOut)
- Building code improvements

### Recent Activity
- Frequent small earthquakes (M2-M4)
- Ridgecrest sequence (2019): M6.4 and M7.1
- Ongoing monitoring by USGS and CalTech
