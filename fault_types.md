# Fault Types

## Overview
Faults are fractures in the Earth's crust where rocks have moved relative to each other. The three main types of faults are classified based on the direction of motion along the fault plane and are directly linked to plate tectonic boundaries.

### Fault Terminology
Before examining fault types, it's important to understand key terms:
- **Fault Plane**: The surface along which rock has fractured and moved.
- **Hanging Wall**: The block of rock above the inclined fault plane.
- **Footwall**: The block of rock below the inclined fault plane.
- **Dip**: The angle the fault plane makes with the horizontal.
- **Strike**: The direction of a horizontal line on the fault plane.

### 1. Normal Faults
**Motion**: The hanging wall moves **downward** relative to the footwall.

**Stress**: Caused by **extensional (pulling-apart) forces**.

**Occurrence**: Found at **divergent plate boundaries** where plates are spreading apart (e.g., mid-ocean ridges and rift valleys).

**Characteristics**:
- The fault plane is typically inclined at steep angles (45Â°â€“90Â°).
- Results in crustal extension, stretching, and basin formation.
- Rift valleys are classic examples.
- Examples: Basin and Range faults in the American Southwest, the East African Rift.

**Earthquakes**: Can generate large earthquakes, though usually less energetic than reverse faults.

### 2. Reverse and Thrust Faults
**Motion**: The hanging wall moves **upward** relative to the footwall.

**Stress**: Caused by **compressional (squeezing) forces**.

**Occurrence**: Found at **convergent plate boundaries** where plates collide (e.g., subduction zones and mountain building zones).

**Sub-categories**:

#### Reverse Faults
- The fault plane is inclined at a moderate to steep angle.
- Can produce massive earthquakes.
- Examples: 1994 Northridge earthquake (M6.7) in California; Japanese subduction zones.

#### Thrust Faults
- A special type of reverse fault with a **very shallow dip angle** (typically less than 45Â°).
- Can push large sheets of rock over great distances.
- Responsible for creating major mountain ranges (e.g., the Himalayas, the Rocky Mountains).
- **Megathrusts**: These are the largest faults on Earth, found at subduction zones. They can produce the most powerful earthquakes (magnitude 9.0+).
- Example: The 2011 TÅhoku megathrust earthquake in Japan (M9.1).

**Characteristics**:
- Results in crustal shortening and mountain building.
- Often associated with folding and complex deformation.

### 3. Strike-Slip Faults
**Motion**: The two blocks slide **horizontally past each other** with minimal vertical motion.

**Stress**: Caused by **shearing forces**.

**Occurrence**: Found at **transform plate boundaries** where plates slide laterally past one another.

**Sub-categories**:

#### Right-Lateral (Dextral) Faults
- The block on the far side of the fault moves to the **right** (when viewed across the fault).

#### Left-Lateral (Sinistral) Faults
- The block on the far side of the fault moves to the **left**.

**Characteristics**:
- The fault plane is nearly vertical.
- Produces frequent, large earthquakesâ€”often damaging because ruptures can extend deep into the crust.
- No vertical offset; horizontal displacement only.
- Examples: The **San Andreas Fault** (right-lateral, California); the **Anatolian Fault** (right-lateral, Turkey).

**Note**: Strike-slip faults do not typically create mountains or trenches, but they can produce significant horizontal displacement over geological time.

### 4. Oblique-Slip Faults
**Motion**: Movement that is **not parallel** to the strike of the fault; combines elements of dip-slip and strike-slip motion.

**Occurrence**: Found where tectonic motion includes both vertical and horizontal components.

**Examples**: The Seattle Fault and southern Whidbey Island fault zone in Washington State.

### Fault Movement and Earthquakes

#### Locked vs. Creeping Faults
- **Locked Faults**: Friction holds the blocks in place. Stress builds until it exceeds the strength of the rock, triggering an earthquake with sudden, jerky motion.
- **Creeping Faults**: The blocks slip slowly and continuously, releasing stress gradually without producing damaging earthquakes.

#### Stress Build-Up
Earthquakes occur when:
1. Stress accumulates at a locked fault.
2. Stress exceeds the friction between rock blocks.
3. Sudden rupture releases the stored energy as seismic waves.

### Key Concepts
1. **Plate Boundary Association**: Normal faults = divergent; Reverse faults = convergent; Strike-slip = transform.
2. **Dip Angle**: Distinguishes reverse faults from thrust faults (< 45Â° dip = thrust).
3. **Megathrust**: The largest and most powerful faults; found at subduction zones.
4. **Elastic Rebound Theory**: Rocks behave elastically, storing energy until rupture, then releasing it suddenly.
