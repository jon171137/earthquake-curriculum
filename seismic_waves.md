# Seismic Waves

## Overview
Seismic waves are waves of energy that travel through the Earth's layers, resulting from earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, or large man-made explosions. Studying these waves allows scientists to map the Earth's interior.

### 1. Body Waves
Body waves travel through the interior of the Earth. They arrive before surface waves and are of higher frequency.

#### Primary Waves (P-waves)
- **Nature**: Compressional waves (push-pull motion).
- **Speed**: The fastest seismic waves (approx. 6â€“14 km/s depending on depth).
- **Medium**: Can travel through **solids, liquids, and gases**.
- **Experience**: Often felt as a sudden jolt or "thump" at the beginning of an earthquake.
- **Sound**: Because they can move through air, P-waves sometimes produce a low rumbling sound.

#### Secondary Waves (S-waves)
- **Nature**: Shear waves (side-to-side or up-and-down motion perpendicular to travel).
- **Speed**: Slower than P-waves (approx. 60% of P-wave speed).
- **Medium**: Can only travel through **solids**. They are stopped by liquids (like the Earth's outer core).
- **Significance**: The fact that S-waves cannot pass through the outer core is key evidence that the outer core is liquid.

### 2. Surface Waves
Surface waves travel only through the Earth's crust (lithosphere). They are of lower frequency than body waves and are easily distinguished on a seismogram.

#### Love Waves
- **Motion**: Horizontal, side-to-side motion perpendicular to the direction of travel.
- **Speed**: Faster than Rayleigh waves but slower than body waves.
- **Damage**: particularly damaging to building foundations due to the horizontal shearing.

#### Rayleigh Waves
- **Motion**: Rolling motion, similar to ocean waves (retrograde elliptical). The ground moves up and down and side-to-side.
- **Speed**: The slowest of all seismic waves.
- **Experience**: Often felt as a "rolling" sensation.
- **Damage**: Typically responsible for the majority of shaking felt during an earthquake and cause the most significant damage.

### Wave Velocity & Sequence
If you look at a seismogram (record of ground shaking), the waves arrive in a predictable order due to their different speeds:
1.  **P-wave** (First arrival)
2.  **S-wave** (Second arrival)
3.  **Surface Waves** (Last arrival, usually largest amplitude)

**Note**: The time gap between the P-wave and S-wave arrivals is used to calculate the distance from the seismic station to the earthquake's epicenter.

### Key Concepts
1.  **Amplitude**: The height of the wave on a seismogram; relates to the strength of shaking.
2.  **Shadow Zone**: Areas on Earth where specific waves (like S-waves) are not recorded, revealing the Earth's internal structure.
3.  **Frequency**: How often a wave cycle passes a point. Body waves are high frequency; surface waves are low frequency.
