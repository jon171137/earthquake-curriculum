# Plate Tectonics

## Overview
This module explains the theory of plate tectonics, describing how Earth's outer shell is divided into rigid plates that move and interact to shape the planet's surface.

### What are Tectonic Plates?
The Earth's outer layer, known as the **lithosphere**, is not a single solid shell. Instead, it is broken into massive, irregular pieces called **tectonic plates**. These plates float on top of a semi-fluid layer of the mantle called the **asthenosphere**.
- **Major Plates**: Pacific, North American, Eurasian, African, Antarctic, Indo-Australian, and South American.
- **Movement**: Plates move very slowly, typically ranging from 1 to 10 centimeters per year (roughly the speed fingernails grow).

### Types of Plate Boundaries
The most geologically active regions on Earth are found where these plates meet. There are three main types of boundaries:

#### 1. Divergent Boundaries
Occur where two plates move **away** from each other.
- **Process**: As plates separate, magma rises from the mantle to fill the gap, creating new crust.
- **Examples**: The **Mid-Atlantic Ridge** (underwater) and the **East African Rift** (on land).
- **Features**: Rift valleys, mid-ocean ridges, volcanic activity.

#### 2. Convergent Boundaries
Occur where two plates move **towards** each other.
- **Subduction**: When an oceanic plate collides with a continental plate, the denser oceanic plate sinks underneath. This creates deep ocean trenches and volcanic mountain ranges (e.g., the **Andes** or **Cascades**).
- **Collision**: When two continental plates collide, neither sinks. Instead, the crust crumples and uplifts to form massive mountain ranges like the **Himalayas**.
- **Features**: Trenches, volcanoes, major earthquakes, mountain belts.

#### 3. Transform Boundaries
Occur where two plates slide **laterally** past one another.
- **Process**: Crust is neither created nor destroyed. The friction between plates causes stress to build up until it slips, causing earthquakes.
- **Example**: The **San Andreas Fault** in California.
- **Features**: Frequent earthquakes, lack of volcanic activity.

### Mechanisms of Movement
Why do plates move? Scientists believe several forces are at work:
- **Mantle Convection**: Heat from the Earth's core causes the mantle to flow in circular currents, dragging the plates along.
- **Slab Pull**: The weight of a cold, dense sinking plate at a subduction zone pulls the rest of the plate down with it.
- **Ridge Push**: At mid-ocean ridges, the lithosphere is higher. Gravity causes the plate to slide downhill away from the ridge.

### Key Concepts
1. **Lithosphere**: The rigid outer part of the Earth, consisting of the crust and upper mantle.
2. **Asthenosphere**: The softer, hotter layer of the mantle on which the tectonic plates float.
3. **Subduction Zone**: A region where one tectonic plate slides beneath another.
4. **Plate Boundary**: The border where two tectonic plates meet and interact.

### Impact on Earth
Plate tectonics is responsible for:
- The position of continents and oceans.
- The formation of mountains and volcanoes.
- The distribution of most earthquakes worldwide.
