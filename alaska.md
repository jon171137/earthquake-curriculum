# Alaska

## Overview
Alaska is the most seismically active region in the United States, experiencing more earthquakes than any other state. Located along the Aleutian megathrust subduction zone where the Pacific Plate subducts beneath the North American Plate, Alaska has experienced the largest earthquake ever recorded in North America and hosts numerous ongoing seismic hazards.

## Content

### Tectonic Setting
Alaska's extraordinary seismic activity is driven by subduction zone dynamics along the southern margin:
- **Subduction Zone**: The Pacific Plate subducts beneath the North American Plate at a rate of approximately 6â€“8 cm per year, creating the Alaska-Aleutian megathrust.
- **Extent**: The subduction zone extends approximately 3,200 km (2,000 miles) from the Aleutian Islands through the Gulf of Alaska and along the southern coast.
- **Plate Interface**: The megathrust interface is locked in some segments (accumulating stress for future great earthquakes) and is decoupled or creeping in others (experiencing aseismic slip).
- **Seismic Gap Concept**: The "Shumagin Gap" along the Aleutian subduction zone has been identified as a region where no great (M8+) earthquake has occurred in recent centuries, suggesting potential for a future megathrust event.
- **Shallow vs. Deep Events**: While megathrust earthquakes dominate, intraplate earthquakes also occur within the subducting Pacific Plate itself.

### Major Historical Earthquakes

#### 1964 Great Alaska Earthquake (M9.2)
- **Date**: March 27, 1964, 5:36 p.m. AKST (Good Friday)
- **Location**: South-central Alaska, Prince William Sound region
- **Significance**: The **second largest earthquake ever instrumentally recorded globally** and the **largest in North American history**
- **Magnitude**: M9.2â€“9.3 (moment magnitude); released at least twice as much energy as the 1906 San Francisco earthquake (M7.9)
- **Duration**: Lasted 4â€“4.5 minutes, among the longest earthquake durations ever recorded
- **Rupture**: Approximately 600 miles (970 km) of the Alaska-Aleutian megathrust ruptured. The rupture released about 500 years of accumulated stress buildup.
- **Vertical Displacement**:
  - Uplift: Up to 38â€“82 feet (11â€“25 meters) in some areas (east of Kodiak Island and Prince William Sound).
  - Subsidence: Up to 8 feet (2.5 meters) in other areas west of the rupture zone.
  - Total area affected: At least 46,442 square miles (120,000 kmÂ²) tilted by the earthquake.
- **Deaths**: 131 total (115 in Alaska, 16 in Oregon and California). The toll would have been far higher except for two fortunate timing factors: (1) it occurred on a Friday evening when schools were empty, businesses uncrowded, and most people were at home; (2) it occurred at low tide, limiting tsunami inundation heights.
- **Casualties by Cause**:
  - 16 direct deaths from earthquake shaking, landslides, and structural collapse in Alaska.
  - 115 deaths from tsunamis (90% of total deaths).
- **Infrastructure Damage**:
  - Anchorage: Massive landslides in the Turnagain Heights neighborhood destroyed 75 homes and about 200 acres. Downtown Anchorage sustained severe damage; buildings on 4th Avenue sank 10â€“20 feet into the ground due to liquefaction.
  - Government Hill Elementary School was split in two by ground rupture.
  - Turnagain and Kodiak: Coastal subsidence created "ghost forests" (drowned trees) and destroyed harbors.
  - Seward: The port and industrial district were destroyed by tsunamis; the southern terminus of the Alaska Railroad was obliterated.
  - Valdez: Destruction prompted relocation of the town 4 miles inland to firmer ground.
  - Girdwood and Portage: Destroyed by subsidence and tidal inundation; Portage was abandoned; Girdwood was relocated.
  - Clear Air Force Station: The ballistic missile detection radar was the only time it had an unscheduled operational interruption in its history.
  - Kodiak: Tsunami lifted the crab fishing fleet out of the harbor and carried boats through the town; canneries disappeared.
- **Tsunamis**:
  - Local: Waves up to 220 feet (67 meters) high were generated in bays and fjords adjacent to the epicenter.
  - Distant: Tsunamis reached Crescent City, California (where 13 died and 30 blocks were destroyed, representing half the waterfront business district), with damage estimated at $7.4 million ($76 million in 2025 dollars).
  - Oregon: 5 deaths; Hawaii: Multiple communities damaged.
- **Damage Summary**: Total property damage estimated at $116 million in 1964 ($894 million in 2024 dollars); some sources cite $400 million (approximately $4.1 billion in today's dollars).
- **Broader Impacts**:
  - Swayed the Space Needle in Seattle 980 km away.
  - Sloshed water out of swimming pools in New Jersey.
  - Felt across all of Alaska, parts of Canada, and south to Washington State.
- **Recovery & Legacy**:
  - President Lyndon Johnson declared all of Alaska a major disaster area.
  - The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers spent $110 million ($1.4 billion today) on reconstruction, debris clearance, and infrastructure repair.
  - The West Coast and Alaska Tsunami Warning Center was established directly in response to this earthquake.
  - Anchorage adopted significantly stronger building codes; Valdez rebuilt on more geologically stable ground.
  - The disaster led to pioneering research in earthquake engineering and disaster recovery.

### Infrastructure Vulnerabilities
- **Soil Conditions**: Weak soils in certain areas (e.g., Bootlegger Cove clay underlying Anchorage) are highly susceptible to liquefaction and ground failure.
- **Coastal Development**: Critical infrastructure (ports, harbors, military facilities) are located in coastal areas vulnerable to both earthquake shaking and tsunami.
- **Population Concentration**: While Alaska's population is sparse overall, Anchorage is a concentrated urban center directly in the zone of highest seismic hazard.
- **Utility Networks**: Water, sewer, gas, electrical, and communication lines can be severely disrupted by ground failures and landslides.
- **Transportation**: Highways, bridges, and the Alaska Railroad network are critical and vulnerable to earthquake damage, particularly in areas with problematic soils.

### Seismic Risk Assessment
- **Earthquake Frequency**: Alaska experiences the highest seismicity rate of any U.S. state. Over the past century, Alaska has experienced 60 earthquakes of magnitude 7.0 or greater, with 56 located along the southern margin.
- **Annual Activity**: In recent years, Alaska experiences hundreds of small earthquakes and frequent larger events (M4â€“M6). Recent data shows nearly 500 earthquakes in a single week is not unusual for Alaska.
- **Megathrust Threat**: Segments of the Alaska-Aleutian megathrust that have not recently ruptured pose significant risk. The Shumagin Gap, Kodiak segment, and other regions are considered potential sources for future M8+ earthquakes.
- **Return Periods**: Major megathrust earthquakes (M8.5+) in any given segment may recur on timescales of centuries; however, continuous monitoring shows variable coupling along the fault, complicating long-term forecasts.

### Preparedness Efforts
- **Alaska Earthquake Center**: Established in 1987 as a partnership between the USGS and the University of Alaska Fairbanks. It provides 24/7 seismic monitoring and operates the Alaska Seismic Hazards Safety Commission (established 2002).
- **Building Codes**: Anchorage and other communities have adopted rigorous earthquake-resistant building standards, continuously updated based on research and experience.
- **Tsunami Warning System**: The West Coast and Alaska Tsunami Warning Center provides alerts for tsunami threats in the region.
- **Tsunami Preparedness**: Many coastal communities have completed tsunami inundation studies, developed evacuation routes, and designated safe zones. Regular drills and public education are conducted.
- **Geotechnical Analysis**: Engineers continue to study problematic soils (liquefaction potential, slope stability) to inform building practices and land use planning.
- **Monitoring**: Continuous seismic monitoring provides real-time detection of earthquakes and assessment of tsunami risks.

### Recent Activity
- Alaska experiences hundreds to thousands of small earthquakes annually; major events (M5+) occur regularly.
- Recent notable activity: M7.1 Anchorage earthquake (November 30, 2018); M6.0 near Susitna (November 27, 2025); M5.8 west of Adak (November 22, 2025).
- Ongoing concern about specific seismic gaps and uncoupled segments of the megathrust.
- Continuous research by the Alaska Earthquake Center, USGS, and university researchers to better understand megathrust dynamics and improve hazard assessment.
