# Seismology Basics

## Overview
Introduction to the science of earthquakes and how they occur.

### What is an Earthquake?
An earthquake is the shaking of the Earth's surface caused by a sudden release of energy in the Earth's crust. This energy creates seismic waves that travel through the Earth.

### Causes of Earthquakes
- **Tectonic plate movements**: Most earthquakes occur at plate boundaries
- **Volcanic activity**: Magma movement can trigger earthquakes
- **Human activity**: Mining, reservoir filling, fracking

### Key Concepts
1. **Hypocenter (Focus)**: The point underground where the earthquake originates
2. **Epicenter**: The point on the Earth's surface directly above the hypocenter
3. **Seismic waves**: Energy waves that travel through the Earth

### Frequency and Distribution
- Approximately 500,000 detectable earthquakes occur worldwide each year
- About 100,000 can be felt by humans
- Major damaging earthquakes (magnitude 7.0+) occur about 10-20 times per year
