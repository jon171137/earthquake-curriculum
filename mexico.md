# Mexico

## Overview
Mexico is situated on one of the world's major subduction zones, where the oceanic Cocos Plate subducts beneath the continental North American Plate. This active plate boundary generates frequent and often damaging earthquakes. Mexico City, built on the soft, waterlogged remnants of a drained lake, is particularly vulnerable to earthquake amplification and has suffered devastating damage from distant megathrust earthquakes. Mexico exemplifies how local geology can catastrophically amplify seismic shaking even at great distances from an epicenter.

### Tectonic Setting
Mexico's seismic activity is driven by subduction along the Middle America Trench:
- **Cocos Plate Subduction**: The Cocos Plate subducts beneath the North American Plate at a rate of approximately 6â€“7 cm per year along the western coast.
- **Variable Slab Geometry**: The subducting slab exhibits complex geometry with variations in dip angle:
  - Steep subduction in Jalisco (western Mexico) and the Tehuantepec Isthmus.
  - Nearly horizontal ("flat slab") subduction beneath central Mexico.
  - This variation in geometry produces different earthquake mechanisms and stress distributions.
- **Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt**: The subduction zone is associated with an active continental volcanic arc spanning Mexico, with over 300 seismically active crustal faults in the subduction zones alone.
- **Seismic Gaps**: The MichoacÃ¡n Gap was identified as a locked segment where seismic energy had been accumulating since at least 1911, with earthquakes having occurred on either side during the 1970s. This gap ruptured in 1985 and again in subsequent events.

### Major Historical Earthquakes

#### 1911 Guerrero Earthquake (M~7.8â€“8.0)
- **Date**: January 15, 1911
- **Location**: Guerrero state
- **Significance**: Ruptured the Guerrero segment of the subduction zone, after which the MichoacÃ¡n gap began accumulating stress
- **Impact**: Caused significant damage in Guerrero state; sparsely populated epicentral area meant lower overall death toll

#### 1985 Mexico City Earthquake (M8.0â€“8.1)
- **Date**: September 19, 1985 at 7:18 a.m. local time
- **Location**: Off the coast of MichoacÃ¡n, approximately 380â€“400 km west-southwest of Mexico City (in the MichoacÃ¡n gap)
- **Magnitude**: M8.0â€“8.1 (surface wave magnitude, varies by source)
- **Deaths**: Official estimates: 9,500â€“10,000; some sources cite up to 40,000 total deaths. Low-end estimates (~3,000) refer only to direct earthquake deaths in Mexico City.
- **Injuries**: Approximately 30,000 treated for injuries
- **Homelessness**: Approximately 100,000 left homeless
- **Property Damage**: $3â€“4 billion in damages; over 412 buildings collapsed completely; approximately 3,124 buildings badly damaged or destroyed
- **Collapsed Buildings**: 3,536 structures collapsed or were seriously damaged throughout the affected region
- **Unique Urban Impact**: Despite the epicenter being 380 km away, Mexico City suffered catastrophic damage due to the city's unique geology (see below)
- **Infrastructure Failure**:
  - Central Communications Center (15-story building) collapsed: This building failure caused the collapse of long-distance communication systems between Mexico City and the rest of the world, severely hampering emergency response and international coordination.
  - Multiple hospitals were damaged, including a maternity ward where some babies were located.
  - Water mains ruptured, causing fires and explosions as broken gas lines ignited.
  - Damage concentrated in the downtown historic district (CuauhtÃ©moc).
- **Mechanism**: Megathrust rupture on the Cocos-North American plate boundary
- **Aftershocks**: A second major earthquake (M7.5) struck the following evening, southeast of the first epicenter
- **Why Mexico City Was So Devastated**:
  - **Lake Bed Geology**: Mexico City was built on the dry bed of the drained Lake Texcoco, with loose lacustrine (lake) sediments comprising the foundation.
  - **Resonance Amplification**: The loose sediments amplified ground motion by up to 5 times compared to areas with firmer soil. Most severely affected were buildings of 5â€“15 stories, which interacted with the resonant frequency of the shaking, creating harmonic resonance and excessive motion.
  - **Liquefaction**: Saturated sediments underwent liquefaction during strong shaking, losing their solid structure and behaving like liquid. This undermined building foundations, causing differential settling and structural failure.
  - **Distance Paradox**: Although far from the epicenter, Mexico City suffered worse damage than many areas closer to the epicenter because of its unique geological conditions.
- **Broader Geographic Impact**: The earthquake was felt by approximately 20 million people across an area of 825,000 kmÂ². Damage extended to other states, though less severe.

#### 2017 Mexico City Earthquake (M7.1)
- **Date**: September 19, 2017 (32 years to the day after the 1985 earthquake)
- **Location**: Flat Slab region, south of Mexico City
- **Magnitude**: M7.1 (some sources list M7.6)
- **Deaths**: 38 buildings collapsed in Mexico City; initial death toll approximately 370 (lower than 1985 despite similar magnitude due to improved building codes)
- **Significance**: Demonstrated the effectiveness of post-1985 building code improvements while also highlighting ongoing compliance issues
- **Infrastructure**: Similar damage patterns to 1985; updated codes prevented some collapses but non-compliance by some developers led to failures
- **Mechanism**: Earthquake occurred in the flat-slab region, a complex structural setting

#### 2022 Mexico Earthquake (M7.6)
- **Date**: September 19, 2022
- **Location**: MichoacÃ¡n State
- **Magnitude**: M7.6
- **Significance**: Another significant megathrust earthquake in a historically active area
- **Impact**: Continued reminders of Mexico's seismic hazard, particularly on September 19 (now known as Mexico Earthquake Preparedness Day)

### Infrastructure Vulnerabilities
- **Mexico City Geology**: The city's construction on a drained lakebed creates a persistent and unique vulnerability to liquefaction and amplified shaking.
- **Soft Sediment Layers**: Thick sequences of unconsolidated sediments lack the structural capacity to transmit seismic energy efficiently, leading to resonance of mid-rise buildings (5â€“15 stories).
- **Non-Ductile Concrete**: Many older buildings, particularly those constructed before or immediately after 1985, were built with poorly reinforced non-ductile concrete, highly vulnerable to collapse.
- **Building Code Compliance**: While post-1985 building codes were stringent, compliance has been problematic. A 2016 study found 71% of buildings constructed after 2004 failed to meet high compliance thresholds.
- **Inspection System Flaws**: Privatization of building inspections created conflicts of interest, with developers hiring preferred inspectors and circumventing regulations.
- **Lifeline Vulnerability**: Water, sewer, gas, and electrical systems are vulnerable to rupture and failure.
- **Hospital Infrastructure**: Medical facilities are critical for earthquake response but themselves are vulnerable to seismic damage.

### Seismic Risk Assessment
- **Frequency**: Mexico experiences hundreds of earthquakes annually. Significant events (M6+) occur several times per year. Damaging earthquakes (M7+) occur every 10â€“20 years on average.
- **Subduction Zone Threat**: The Cocos Plate subduction zone is capable of producing M8.0â€“8.5 earthquakes. Multiple segments have produced great earthquakes historically.
- **MichoacÃ¡n Gap**: Although it ruptured in 1985, stress is again accumulating in this segment.
- **Flat Slab Region**: The unusual flat-slab geometry beneath central Mexico is a source of intermediate-depth earthquakes (M7â€“7.5).
- **Economic Exposure**: Mexico City has a population of over 21 million (metropolitan area) with enormous economic, political, and cultural significance. A M8.5+ megathrust earthquake could cause catastrophic losses.

### Preparedness Efforts
- **Building Codes**: Post-1985, Mexico enacted progressively more stringent seismic building codes, with major revisions in 1993 and 2004 incorporating advances in shock-wave propagation and foundation technology.
- **Code Innovations**: Modern codes mandate earthquake-resistant design principles, ductile reinforced concrete, and advanced foundation techniques.
- **Inspection and Enforcement**: Following the 2017 earthquake, the Mexico City prosecutor's office opened nearly 150 investigations into building collapses, charging builders with homicide, fraud, and negligence for code violations. This represents a significant shift toward accountability.
- **National Earthquake Preparedness**: September 19 is now designated as Mexico Earthquake Preparedness Day, with annual drills and public education.
- **Tsunami Warning**: The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center provides alerts for potential tsunamis from distant megathrust earthquakes.
- **Research and Monitoring**: Continuous seismic monitoring by Mexico's Seismic Alert System (SASMEX). The country operates a network of accelerometers and seismometers.
- **Rapid Alert System**: Early warning systems attempt to provide seconds to tens of seconds of warning before strong shaking reaches Mexico City, allowing automated actions (e.g., train braking, elevator stopping).
- **Community Education**: Public campaigns emphasize earthquake safety and the "Drop, Cover, Hold On" protocol.

### Recent Activity
- Frequent small to moderate earthquakes (M2â€“M5) occur throughout Mexico and along the subduction zone.
- 2022 M7.6 MichoacÃ¡n earthquake served as a reminder of ongoing seismic hazard.
- Continued research on the Cocos Plate subduction zone to better understand strain accumulation and earthquake rupture behavior.
- Monitoring of specific seismic gaps for stress accumulation and future earthquake potential.
