# Earthquake Measurement

## Overview
Earthquakes are measured using two distinct but complementary systems: magnitude scales that quantify the energy released, and intensity scales that describe the effects experienced at specific locations.

## Content

### Magnitude: Energy Released
**Magnitude** measures the **total energy released** by an earthquake at its source. It is a single, instrumental value assigned to each earthquake based on seismometer recordings.

#### The Richter Scale (Local Magnitude)
Developed by Charles Richter in 1935, this was the first widely-used magnitude scale.
- **Method**: Measures the amplitude (height) of the largest seismic wave recorded on a seismogram.
- **Range**: Typically 0â€“9.0, though values above 8.5 are rare.
- **Limitations**:
  - Becomes inaccurate for very large earthquakes (magnitude 7+). It "saturates," meaning it underestimates energy released by strong earthquakes.
  - Only reliable for nearby earthquakes within ~600 km of the epicenter.
  - Measures only the largest jolt, not the total duration of shaking.

#### The Moment Magnitude Scale (Mw)
Introduced in 1979 and now the **standard used by seismologists worldwide**.
- **Method**: Based on the **seismic moment**, which incorporates:
  - The area of the fault that ruptured
  - The average amount of rock displacement (slip)
  - The rigidity of the rock
- **Advantages**: Does not saturate; accurately measures earthquakes of all sizes, including the largest recorded events.
- **Energy Relationship**: Each increase of 1.0 in magnitude represents approximately **32 times more energy released**.

**Example**: A magnitude 7.0 earthquake releases about 32 times more energy than a magnitude 6.0 earthquake.

### Intensity: Shaking Effects
**Intensity** measures the **strength and effects of shaking** at specific locations. Unlike magnitude, intensity varies from place to place based on distance from the epicenter, local geology, and building construction.

#### Modified Mercalli Intensity (MMI) Scale
Uses Roman numerals (Iâ€“X) to categorize earthquake effects based on observations of people, damage to structures, and changes to the landscape.

**Scale Overview:**
- **Iâ€“II**: Not felt or felt by very few
- **IIIâ€“IV**: Felt indoors; some objects move
- **Vâ€“VI**: Felt by nearly everyone; some damage occurs
- **VIIâ€“VIII**: Moderate to considerable damage; some structural failures
- **IXâ€“X**: Severe damage; extensive destruction or total ruin

### Key Differences: Magnitude vs. Intensity

| **Aspect** | **Magnitude** | **Intensity** |
|---|---|---|
| **What It Measures** | Total energy released at source | Strength of shaking at specific locations |
| **Number of Values** | One per earthquake | Multiple values across affected area |
| **How It's Determined** | Seismometer instruments | Observations, damage reports, people's experiences |
| **Variation** | Same for all locations | Varies with distance and local conditions |
| **Scale** | Typically 0â€“9+ | Roman numerals Iâ€“X |

### Key Concepts
1. **Seismic Moment**: The total moment release of an earthquake, incorporating fault area, slip amount, and rock rigidity.
2. **Seismogram**: A graphic record of ground motion produced by a seismometer.
3. **Logarithmic Scale**: Both magnitude scales are logarithmicâ€”each step represents a 10-fold increase in amplitude and roughly 32 times more energy.
4. **Epicenter**: The point on Earth's surface directly above where the earthquake originated (hypocenter).

### Practical Applications
- **Magnitude** is used to categorize earthquakes globally and assess seismic hazard.
- **Intensity** is used for damage assessment, emergency response planning, and building code development.
- **Together**, they provide a complete picture of an earthquake's size and effects.
